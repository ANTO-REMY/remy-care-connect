## Introduction

This feature adds a responsive hamburger menu for smaller screen displays that contains the navbar text links and login button. The hamburger menu will improve mobile user experience by providing an accessible navigation solution when screen real estate is limited. All components will be made responsive to work seamlessly across all screen sizes.
